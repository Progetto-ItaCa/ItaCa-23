The 4th ItaCa Workshop will take place in Turin, Italy, on 18-19 December 2023. 

ItaCa Workshop is a series of short workshops organized by [ItaCa](https://progetto-itaca.github.io), the Italian community of category theorists. The focus lies on the development and applications of category theory.

Students and early career researchers are particularly encouraged to attend and to submit talk proposals.

The workshop will take place in person, but we plan to stream the talks on the ItaCa Youtube channel. We also plan to register the talks and to upload them on the ItaCa YouTube channel.
